# CDC React Component Library

This is a React component library for official CDC sites. At its core, it uses the official USWDS styles. It is written in TypeScript and built with Vite.

## Running Unit Tests

This project uses Vitest to run unit tests against its components and utilties. Run unit tests with the command `yarn test`.

## Building the Project
